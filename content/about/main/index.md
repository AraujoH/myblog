  As I head into my second semester, I am focusing on the ins and outs of electricity markets in the US and they are regulated. The goal is to understand the challenges of ensuring the grid remains flexible and reliable in the face of new technology, new regulation and higher penetration of variable renewable energy. 
  
  On the methodology side of things, I'm taking deep dives into optimization theory and stochastic processes. The former is necessary to model sequential decision-making processes in the search for the optimal policy. The latter is crucial to understand and model the uncertainty we must deal with when making decisions.
  
  On the programming front, I am [JuMPing](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/) on the [Julia Language](https://julialang.org/) bandwagon.
