<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I'm a Civil and Environmental Engineering Ph.D. student studying how electricity market design and energy policy can aid the transition to a low-carbon economy.

Besides that, I am also interested in optimization, stochastic processes, and ... 

Outside of research, you can find me drinking coffee while I take long walks to decide which book/podcast I'll pick up next.
